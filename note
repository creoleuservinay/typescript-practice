Today i explored/practice the following.
1.Watch mode to see immediate change.
2.Options in tsconfig.json after inilize ts file.
    - libs
    - outDir: by using this seperate the js file into subfolder.
    - rootDir: by using this seperate the ts file into subfolder.
    - target
    - strict  /* Strict Type-Checking Option */
    - strictNullChecks  /* Strict Type-Checking Option */
    - noUnusedLocals": true,  /* Additional Check */
    .
    .
    - noUnusedParameters /* Additional Check */

1.Type Aliases/Custom type: like how we combine more then one type to make our custom type.
 - simple variable as custom type, object as custom type.
2.Type Casting: By adding a button element and converting its type simple Htmlelement to specific button on dom.
3.let and const in type script:
4.Spread operator: We can pull out the values.
5.rest parameter: when we are thinking to expact unexpacted parameter.
6.Parameter type notation, return type anotation, anonymous function.
7.optional property.

Many things are remaining in type script functions will continue in same order.

Sir i explored/practice the following topics today.

1.Anonymous functions.
2.Array and object destructring.
3. Class(property, methods), the constructor in typescript.
- play around with class property and methods of the class by creating Instances of a class using new keywords.

- Inheritance:
--Can simply inherit the base class properties/methods into derived class.
--derived classes also have their own property including base class property.
-- utilize 'protected/private access modifier during Inherited the base class.

- Constructor:
--play around with a simple constructor which is responsible to assign value to the property of a class.
-- super() : by using super keyword to play around with the base class constructor into the derived class constructor to understand the flow.
Â 4.strictPropertyInitialization option in tsc.

I am trying to utilize old topics like array/object/type anotation into class and function/method to more clear understading.
